## Helloooo! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my profile 

I am a Full Stack Developer, i have been programming since I was 13 years old. It is a great pleasure to receive you on my git hub page.
I make available some of my projects in repository for you to download and use as examples. Constantly add new projects, both backend and frotend.
I always try to study the most important of current technology, evolving my knowledge every day more. And putting that into practice in my projects and in the job market.

âš¡ Thank you so much for taking the time to read a little about me âš¡
